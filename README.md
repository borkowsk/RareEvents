# "RareEvents" - few models for "Rare events exhibition" in Warsaw 

This set of models was commissioned by the Center for Contemporary Art in Warsaw for the "Rare events" exhibition. Unfortunately, after Adobe has ceased support for Action Script, there is no way to further develop it or even run it.

After Turbo Pascal and Delphi, it's another language whose resources are at a loss.
